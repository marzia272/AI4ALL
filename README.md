# EEG Emotion Recognition: Positive vs Negative Detection
# [Link to Project Github repository](https://marzia272.github.io/AI4ALL/)
Improved EEG-based emotion classification accuracy to 63% for binary classification (positive vs. negative emotion) using Random Forest, applying data preprocessing, feature selection, and model tuning within the AI4ALL Ignite program.

## Problem Statement <!--- do not change this line -->

Emotions play a vital role in human interaction, and understanding them through brainwave signals can enhance mental health tools, adaptive learning systems, and human-computer interaction. EEG data provides rich neural activity patterns, but overlapping signals between emotions make classification challenging. This project aimed to develop a machine learning model capable of reliably distinguishing between positive and negative emotions from EEG recordings.

## Key Results <!--- do not change this line -->

1. Increased classification accuracy to 63% for binary emotion detection.  
2. Balanced dataset to reduce class bias and improve fairness in predictions.  
3. Identified top EEG channels contributing to classification performance.  

## Methodologies <!--- do not change this line -->

1. Collected and preprocessed EEG data (cleaning, scaling, balancing).  
2. Selected top EEG channels for improved model performance.  
3. Trained and tuned a Random Forest model for binary emotion classification.  
4. Evaluated results using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
