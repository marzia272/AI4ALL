# EEG Emotion Classification using Machine Learning

Improved EEG-based emotion classification accuracy to 63% for binary classification (positive vs. negative emotion) using Random Forest, applying data preprocessing, feature selection, and model tuning within the AI4ALL Ignite program.

*EXAMPLE:*
*Uncovered and meticulously analyzed three distinct biases present in ChatGPT, employing advanced Python techniques and data analysis methodologies, all within AI4ALL's cutting-edge AI4ALL Ignite accelerator.*


## Problem Statement <!--- do not change this line -->

Emotions play a vital role in human interaction, and understanding them through brainwave signals can enhance mental health tools, adaptive learning systems, and human-computer interaction. EEG data provides rich neural activity patterns, but overlapping signals between emotions make classification challenging. This project aimed to develop a machine learning model capable of reliably distinguishing between positive and negative emotions from EEG recordings.

*EXAMPLE:*
*Given the substantial daily output of responses, the identification and mitigation of ChatGPT's biases become critical, safeguarding both the multitude of users and the far-reaching consequences they may influence.*

## Key Results <!--- do not change this line -->

1. Increased classification accuracy to 63% for binary emotion detection.

2. Balanced dataset to reduce class bias and improve fairness in predictions.

3. Identified top EEG channels contributing to classification performance.

*EXAMPLE:*
1. *Recorded over 1,000 unique prompts and their responses generated by ChatGPT*
2. *Identified three biases in ChatGPT's responses*
   - *When prompted about this world event*
   - *When prompted about this field of science*
   - *When prompted about this political party*


## Methodologies <!--- do not change this line -->

1. Collected and preprocessed EEG data (cleaning, scaling, balancing).

2. Selected top EEG channels for improved model performance.

3. Trained and tuned a Random Forest model for binary emotion classification.

4. Evaluated results using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

*EXAMPLE:*
*To accomplish this, we utilized the OpenAI API to interact with ChatGPT, and we designed a custom Python script to generate diverse prompts and collect corresponding responses. The data was then processed and analyzed using pandas, enabling us to detect patterns and biases in the AI model's outputs.*
*Engineered a Python script to generate over 1,000 prompts and elicit their responses from ChatGPT, utilizing pandas to collect the data. When prompted for solutions to this specific relevant crisis, nearly 80% of ChatGPT's responses promoted a certain worldview.*
